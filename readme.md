Overview
--------

NBrowse is a command-line utility to browse and execute search queries in .NET
compiled assemblies (both .NET Framework and .NET Standard). It exposes loaded
assemblies through a standard set of traversable entities (e.g. "assembly",
"project", "type", "method" and so on) and allows you to run C# statements to
query anything you want to retrieve from them.

You can think of it as a stripped down [NDepend](https://www.ndepend.com/)
equivalent with no graphical interface.

This example will search in assembly `NBrowse.dll` for every type that
implements interface `IPrinter` and print them to standard output:

    $ dotnet NBrowse.CLI.dll -c '
        /* Take all loaded assemblies */
        p => p.Assemblies
        /* Select declared types from each of them */
        .SelectMany(a => a.Types)
        /* Filter on types having an interface named "IPrinter" */
        .Where(t => t.Interfaces.Any(i => i.Name == "IPrinter"))' NBrowse.dll

Usage
-----

Download latest [release](https://github.com/r3c/nbrowse/releases) from GitHub
or checkout code and build using your preferred
[.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or
[.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework-runtime/net472)
SDK.

Once you have a NBrowse.CLI executable file, run it with `-h` command line
argument to display help.

    $ dotnet NBrowse.CLI -h
